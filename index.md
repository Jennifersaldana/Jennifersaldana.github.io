Hello! I'm a CS student from Houma currently looking for a cybersecurity position.

I'm a senior at Louisiana State University, where I earned my GIAC Penetration Tester Certification (GPEN). I was given the opportunity to work with the Cybersecurity Clinic at LSU. The program was an NSA-funded project that enabled us to conduct penetration testing for small businesses across Louisiana. Most small businesses are targets of hackers, and many cannot afford thousands of dollars in penetration testing and remediation. I also conducted cybersecurity seminars for small businesses, covering how attackers utilize OSINT and the phases of a penetration test.
